bugfixes and additions are greatly appreciated, however a basic knowledge of Javascript and Node.js are expected.
simply `npm install` in the main directory, then get started. 
I kindly ask that you squash commits before making a pull request

I should probably add more to this, but that is for later (pls create a PR with a more detailed version of this)
